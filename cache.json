It’s fun but I was a little frustrated with the process of sourcing and printing out graph paper with an isomorphic grid on it. You have two bad options, basically:\nDownload a low-res JPG you found on Google Image search where the grid sizes are wonky and it has a giant URL on it. I needed something clean and simple.\nBuy grid paper on Amazon in bulk. Now I’m thinking about centimeters vs. inches, cost, color, paper size, style, and quantity before I draw a single dungeon. I needed something ad hoc and with less commitment.\nAfter 15 minutes of getting frustrated I said “I can build this.” And so I did using HTML, CSS, and the tiniest bit of JavaScript. And because it’s a webpage… why limit myself to one kind of grid? I’m able to support ~7 grids types using different kinds of background gradients:\nGrids\nDot Grids\nIsomorphic Grids\nIsomorphic Dot Grids\nDual Hex Grids\nPerspective Grids\nTwo-Point Perspective Grids\nFeeling good about this little tool. The quality can be a bit blurry but background gradients and printers are weird. It’d be nice to make it crisper and I might put some effort at the task (use SVG patterns?)… but at less than 5kb and a couple of nights worth of work, I’m happy with the result. It “made the rounds” as they say on the socials and seems to be a common issue other people experience, so I’ll call that a success.",

          "description": "Inkwell Games bills itself as “Daily puzzles worth thinking about” and that’s a great tagline. Right now they offer two daily puzzles: Stars and Fields. Both are enjoyable but I rank Stars as a bit above Fields but as I get better at understanding the patterns of Fields it’s growing on me each day.\nLike the NYT, the puzzles grow in difficulty over the week and don’t feel bad if you miss a day because they’ll let you play any of other the puzzles from that week. I highly recommend Stars as a starter, it’s like Minesweeper meets Sudoku where each row, column, and box has two stars. It seems impossible at first, but over time you get a rhythm for cracking this cryptic.\nOne feature both Stars and Fields have that might be controversial to puzzle purists is a “Check” button. In practice this acts sort of like a “Guess” button where you’re at a dead end and have a guess, but don’t know for sure. It happens a lot in Fields where you’re staring at a grid of numbers with no clear move. Inkwell even wrote a blog post trying to de-stigmatize looking ahead which I appreciate immensely. The purist part of your brain feels guilty guessing at first, but in some ways it teaches you to trust your gut and intuition over time. I used to always need guesses in Stars and Fields but I’ve finished dozens on both now with zero guesses. That’s improvement and the wrinkles in my brain tingle with progress.\nIf you’re a fan of daily puzzle games, put these in your routine. The playful aesthetic of Inkwell Games’ games always bring a smile. I’m excited to try their upcoming puzzle Snakes and roll it into my daily routine.",

It’s a little if-this-then-that logic puzzle where Pam implicates Bob as a criminal and because Bob is a plumber and there’s one innocent plumber then Sally is innocent. It starts simple but overtime but often the clues will feel like they lead to a dead end… but there’s always a way to solve the puzzle. It has a sudoku-like quality to it. Like the NYT crossword the difficulty scales up over the week and is a good way to burn 10 minutes.\nClues by Sam is great. It’s the first game in my daily puzzle routine. It makes me feel like the world’s greatest detective sometimes. Other times it makes me realize I’m not detail-oriented enough to be an investigator. The whole puzzle is a dopamine rush and a pang of sadness hits when I finish the puzzle for there are no more Clues By Sam left to solve that day. I think that’s a good sign of a good game; players wanting to come back. But lucky for me, Clues By Sam is now offering a puzzle pack of 50 puzzles. A nice way to hook people when they’re already addicted.",

Despite the gold in the hills, La Rinconada is a poor town. One documentary suggests people end up here because that’s the only option left for them.

Like Groundhog’s day but set in fictionalized 17th century Salem. While I appreciated the easy grade at the time due to uncoordinated curriculum, reading and acting out The Crucible half a dozen times in those formative years means it left an imprint on my subconscious.\nThere’s a scene in Act 2 when famous demonologist and witch hunter Reverend John Hale visits protagonist John Proctor. He’s there to shake him down about his poor church attendance and also insinuate his wife is a witch. Proctor defends himself (and his wife) and during his defense makes a big deal about the golden candlesticks in the small, clapboard church (that Proctor put the roof on).…",

As most are well aware, plastic is a major problem polluting our land, our beaches, our rivers, our oceans, and our balls. While Ocean Cleanup is progressing nicely,  only 10% of the world’s plastic is recycled. That’s appallingly low for something we know is a huge issue. That’s the problem Precious Plastic is trying to solve.\n\nHow does Precious Plastic work? Like Project Kamp, they make open source research modules available to help you start a business recycling plastic. They offer guides on building your own machines , creating objects, running a business, and operating a space. There’s even a small marketplace where you can buy injection molds and a library of products for inspiration.  It’s almost like a startup in a box but instead of burning GPUs in Iowa to fancy-autocomplete some text, you’re melting garbage into table tops, cups, bowls, phone cases, and other knickknacks. Or you can specialize in making the raw materials (plastic chips, slabs, etc) that others can use to make their dream products. Nice.\n\nThe coolest part about Precious Plastic is that it’s a distributed open model that empowers local communities to solve their own plastic problems. My favorite example of this model is this young woman in Indonesia who recycled over 70 tons of plastic in two years while making $200k/yr.\n\nInspiring. Anyways, setting up a Precious Plastic facility like this is on my tech-exit vision board short list.",

And this post is about a project that scratches both those itches.\n\nProject Kamp is a sustainable living community in the hills of central Portugal. The unique thing about this cooperative living situation is that they’re sharing the process of reclaiming the land and growing an environmentally friendly community via their YouTube channel and open source modules. As with any project, there are ups and downs but week after week they make progress on tackling their list of problems challenges (which they address every 8th video) while maintaining their core values.\nWhen it comes to making decisions on how to grow or what projects to tackle, Project Kamp prioritizes environmental sustainability above nearly all other factors. That work manifests in installing solar panels, water management, repairing old buildings, waste management for dozens of people using outhouses, converting abandoned trailers into housing using recycled materials, and a lot of chopping down mimosa trees (an invasive species that starves out native oaks). It’s encouraging to watch a group of like-minded folks working to build the kind of world they want to live in.\nAt the time of writing, they’re on Episode #165 and while you don’t have to watch them all (it’s a lot of chopping mimosa trees), I do recommend going back in time a bit to watch the land evolve over time. I dropped in at Season 2 but the quality goes up in Season 3 and can recommend either as a starting point. From the outside looking in, Project Kamp seems like a bunch of sweet people trying hard to build something that lasts. If I was twenty years younger with no kids and still had a back, I’d probably consider applying to stay there.",

He grew his following by engaging with other popular streamers but where I learned about him was his from viral street performances where he dawns a 55-lbs mobile production studio. He puts on his backpack and walks around New York city with a keyboard, a BOSS RC-505 MKII Loop Station, a microphone, and a computer to run it all through Ableton.\nThe beats Ari makes are incredible and his production skills are going to win him a Grammy some day. It’s all off the dome live in front of people while walking down the street. Ari doesn’t stop at beats. He takes it to the next level and invites strangers to hop on the mic and he tailors the beat to their personal style and preferences. It’s improv. It’s art. It’s music. It’s communion. There’s something pure about the creativity happening.\nWhat I think I like best about ARIatHOME is this: Seeing creative people expressing their gifts gives me hope. I know I’m watching six hour livestreams edited down to a 15 minute supercut, but Ari seems to have no trouble finding people who have talent and can rap. It might be becuase New York is the birthplace of hip-hop, but the city isn’t short of people willing to step up to the mic and drop some bars right there in the middle of the street.\nI also love that ARIatHOME reinforces the mythos that New York is a city full of characters.

          "description": "I stumbled onto Odd Artworks’ Random Mini Dungeon video series via the algorithm. He rolls against a dice table to generate a theme and requirements and starts drawing an isomorphic dungeon on a single sheet of paper. It’s almost like a Solo-RPG meets Inktober mashup activity.\nThe process is straight forward: roll dice, spend an hour to an afternoon drawing the dungeon, scan it, add three layers of gray tones for shading, add color, then add glowing effects. All wrapped up in a “Draw and Talk” format, it makes for a nice predictable ASMR formula. He then collects all the dungeons and goblins he draws and puts them in a stapled zine.\nThe cartoony style is adorable and reminds me a bit of Kyle Ferrin from Leder Games’s style, who I’m fond of because I got to play DnD with Kyle once. Generating dungeons this way could be a great way to create one-shot mini-dungeons for your campaign (doubly-so if you run a campaign for kids). As a bonus you could surprise players at the end with a little artwork to remember the campaign.\nAnyways, I think it’s great and adds positive vibes into the world.

The analyzer scans your class-based component to build up a “manifest” of all the methods, events, slots, parts, tag name, and CSS variables you want to expose. It works on a single component or an entire system’s worth of components.

          "description": "这个国庆长假，跟往年过的别无二致。最近10来年，老T除了个别年份的国庆长假期间有外出旅游，其余时间大多是自驾车辆往返于湘粤“两个家”之间。\n如果一定要说有什么不同，那这次主要区别就是因家里出行人数较多，5座小车坐不下，又单独给家人买了火车票。正是这次买火车票的经历，让老T重新认识了巴士这种交通工具。\n曾经的天坑\n\n讲起巴士，老T身上就有一把辛酸史。高中时，从乡里乘车去县城的中巴车上四五次被偷学费、生活费；大学时，从乡里去衡阳火车站的路上也被偷过生活费、手机。就连不经过火车站中转的长途巴士也被骗过。2012年春运，老T花费320元购买了一张衡山到佛山的长途车票，结果车子一到花都，司机就想把乘客赶下车。也就幸好当年老T用的黑莓手机已经有带GPS定位的谷歌地图，最终据理力争下，才让司机把车开进了广州市区。\n\n\n回看这段经历，老T感觉恍如隔世，2012年至今不过13年。电子地图这种新鲜事物在当时大多数人手机上还未普及，而如今，几乎所有人早已习惯电子地图这种基础设施般的服务所带来便利性。也正是这种便利性，让曾经的很多“坑”都被填平了。\n现在是真香\n\n由于老T决定帮家人买火车票时已邻近国庆，只剩两天时间，不管是高铁票还是普铁票，几乎都出售殆尽，只剩一些普铁无座票还有售。没办法，也只能硬着头皮买张广州白云站到长沙火车站的无座票先顶着。毕竟时间也不长，总比超载挤在小车里熬十几个小时堵车要强。\n比较头疼的是进出火车站的交通工具选择。两头的火车站离家都挺远：家里到广州白云站有60公里，从长沙火车站回老家有140公里（正常是到衡阳下，但衡阳没票）。以往常规方法是选择两边的汽车站到汽车站，然后再从汽车站转火车站。\n但老T在微信上搜索发现，现在的巴士，居然已经不需要去汽车站了，而是可以直接在附近公交站上车，甚至有的巴士还能直接上门接送，跟网约车、顺风车没任何区别。\n\n\n最关键的是，这种巴士还特别便宜。老T随手一查，发现广州到深圳的这种巴士居然有长期只卖19.9元的，甚至还有卖9.9元的。\n看到这，老T不禁对此产生了兴趣，想了解下这背后到底有什么原因。\n变化的原因\n\n老T一边刷着各种微信小程序，一边在网上搜罗资料。\n发现，这几年城际巴士的“变身”，主要得益于互联网平台的强势介入。\n过去，巴士运营大多靠传统的汽车站和固定线路，效率低下，成本高企。像老T老家县城的公交公司，前几年亏损后停运了很长一段时间，顺带逼得县城到长沙的热门线路都被砍了一大半，结局就是越降本增效，越进入恶性循环，最终只能全部推倒从头再来，靠着将农村中巴线路全部整合进去，才重新盘活。\n现在，各种互联网平台依托大数据和算法，通过优化线路和调度，能实现点对点甚至上门接送的服务。乘客不用再大老远跑到汽车站排队买票，直接在手机上选好时间和地点，巴士就近上车，省时省力。\n更重要的是，价格为什么这么低？老T觉得，这一方面应该是平台之间的“补贴大战”，为了抢占市场份额，往往通过烧钱补贴来吸引用户，比如五六十公里的线路，长期保持在19.9元甚至9.9元这种“白菜价”。另一方面，大巴电动化所带来的运营成本的降低也功不可没。随着电动巴士的普及，油费支出大幅下降，加上共享经济模式，车辆利用率更高，空载率低，自然能把价格压下来。\n老T看到一篇报道，说这种城际巴士的低价策略，其实并不意味着不赚钱。连顺风车都有全职开的，能载几十人的大巴车，平摊下来成本确实也很低。\n想想看，高铁虽然快，但票价动辄几百；自驾油费加高速费也不少；飞机更别提了。巴士这种“老古董”借着科技东风，摇身一变，竟成了性价比之王。",

          "description": "这几天在知乎有个炒的火热的话题。国家即将开始颁发的K签证，引发很多人焦虑，是否外国人也要进来抢饭碗？\n老T从自己视角也试着简单回答了一下。\n总体来说，我认为这个签证政策对普通人没啥影响。K签讲白了还是个技术移民签证，虽然国家层面还没有制定具体办法，但大概率是按照美国H1B模式的。\n为啥现在要招外国人参与搞技术？\n\n重点还是服务国内制造业产业升级和关联产业需求。最主要是需要有懂第三世界国家语言、习俗、社会规范、消费习惯的人过来参与源头生产。\n毫无疑问，美国IT互联网巨头里边大量印度裔员工，对美国科技公司开拓印度市场、理解印度用户需求、以及产品设计中融入某些印度文化元素，起到了重要的催化剂、加速器和桥梁作用。\n中国制造想要有全球影响力，不是说在终端市场搞些研发中心就能解决问题，不可避免需要更多具有原生文化背景的外国人参与。\n而这类职业生态位，与本国人力资源几乎没有竞争关系。\n对普通人有什么影响？\n\n对普通人而言，K签证的实施几乎不会产生直接冲击。 它并非为了填补国内技术人才的“数量缺口”，而是精准地瞄准了“特定能力缺口”，即中国制造需要深度嵌入新兴市场本土语境（语言、文化、消费心理、社会网络）的稀缺能力。\n这类引进人才的核心价值，在于帮助中国制造业和关联产业从源头设计、生产环节就精准锚定海外目标市场的真实需求，减少“水土不服”。这与本土人才在技术研发、生产管理、国内市场开拓等方面的核心能力是高度互补而非竞争的关系。\n本质上，K签证是中国产业全球化深化到新阶段，为提升“本地化能力”和“源头创新适配性”而进行的一次战略性人才资源配置优化，其影响在于提升中国制造的全球竞争力与渗透力，而非与普通人争夺就业机会。\n会不会引进洋垃圾？\n\n老T也很理解大多数人对这种问题的想法，动则关联到留学生问题。\n但说到底，工作签证的前提是有工作，是国内企业愿意招外国人进来，是老板要真金白银给外国人发工资，需要解决企业内部沟通、管理问题，不可能有哪个老板请个“爹”来上班。如果不能发光发热，或者公司内部排斥导致其无法工作，那自然而然签证也就失效了。",

          "description": "最近受“桦加沙”台风影响，夜里气温不上不下，开空调嫌冷，不开又有点闷。老T想着省点电，就没开空调，靠电风扇吹了一夜。结果，省电不成，倒把自己吹感冒了。\n起初就是个普通感冒，流了两天鼻涕。可没想到，鼻涕快消停时，嗅觉突然又没了！\n这已经是我第四次经历嗅觉丧失了。 第一次是2022年底阳了之后；第二次是2023年，感觉像是新冠回潮；第三次是去年冬天，症状也像新冠。但这次，我敢肯定不是新冠，用试纸测了，只有一条线。\n这让我忍不住琢磨：搞不好前两次也不是新冠呢？ 因为除了第一次阳了和这次测了，中间那两次我其实都没做检测，当时只当是新冠了。现在想想，真有点细思恐极：难道得过新冠之后，再遇上普通感冒也会触发嗅觉失灵？\n作为医学门外汉，老T只好求助网络，想弄清楚感冒和嗅觉失灵之间到底有没有关联，也希望能给有类似经历的朋友一点参考。\n要回答这个问题，得从科学角度切入。老T在 Science 上查到一项研究显示，新冠病毒对嗅觉系统的冲击远超普通感冒。它不像感冒那样主要是鼻塞堵路，而是直接“入侵”嗅觉上皮，也就是鼻子里的那些负责闻味儿的细胞。病毒通过 ACE2 受体进入支持细胞（sustentacular cells），导致炎症风暴，进而影响嗅觉神经元。这不是一次性的损伤，而是可能留下“后遗症”：慢性炎症或神经修复不全，让嗅觉系统变得脆弱。\n\n\n由于老T看不懂这些具体内容，只能简单联想：新冠就好像一场“地震”，震坏了嗅觉基础结构，后续的小感冒则类似“余震”，轻易就能触发嗅觉失灵。\n具体到复发机制，《英国医学杂志》上的 Post-viral olfactory loss and parosmia 文章指出，新冠患者嗅觉失灵的发生率高达 50%，其中许多人会发展为持久型或异嗅（闻到的味道变味儿），感染后6个月仍有27-60%的患者有嗅觉问题，1年后26.5-46%，甚至2年后还有8.3%。\n\n\n为什么普通感冒会“借力打力”？因为感冒病毒（如鼻病毒）通常只引起暂时性鼻炎，但在前新冠患者身上，它可能放大残留的炎症。譬如，一篇案例研究描述了患者反复嗅觉失灵，可能源于过度炎症、再感染或病毒复制反弹。我的经历就很贴合：每次感冒后，不是鼻塞时就失灵，而是恢复期突然发作，这暗示不是机械堵塞，而是神经信号出了岔子。另一项研究进一步证实，后新冠嗅觉功能障碍与“长新冠”相关，涉及免疫细胞浸润和嗅觉上皮基因表达改变，导致系统对新感染更敏感。\n\n\n当然，这其实也不是什么大事，绝大多数情况下，这种嗅觉失常现象，都能在一两个星期内逐渐恢复，尤其是年轻患者。\n我自己这几天也在试着搞点恢复训练，闻闻柠檬、薄荷这些强烈气味，好像现在已经好很多了。\n\n\n假如你也遇上类似情况，别慌，记录下来，或许像我一样，找找背后的科学依据，心里就能多几分踏实。\n生活本就五味杂陈，闻不着时，就多尝尝回忆的味道吧。\n参考文献：\nOlfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as a clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate forms of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A multicenter European study. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00405-020-05965-1\nPost-viral olfactory loss and parosmia. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37841969/\nLong-lasting olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00405-021-07153-1\nNon-neuronal expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfactory system suggests mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated anosmia. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc5801\nPrognosis and persistence of smell and taste dysfunction in patients with covid-19: meta-analysis with parametric cure modelling of recovery curves https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35896188/",

          "description": "从 9 月 1 日老T正式开始启用公众号算起，到今天刚好 10 天，这 10 天说短也短，说长也长。短的是，自 2008 年老T开始网络写作以来，这 10 天几乎可以忽略不计。长的是，这 10 天算是老T 17 年写作历程中收获最多的时期，充满了新鲜感和挑战。\n微信公众号简要回顾\n\n这 10 天里，老T公众号共更新 10 篇文章，其中 8 篇都是从博客搬到公众号的，只有 2 篇是近期新作。\n在 8 篇搬迁的文章中，前 4 篇基本就是直接从博客复制粘贴，后 4 篇经过了大范围修订，几乎相当于重新写了一遍。\n10 篇文章共计阅读量 2.2 万，其中最高的约 1 万，最少的 17。\n\n\n另外，老T也收获了首个赞赏，来自安徽的网友 @Chulixia, 在此表示衷心的感谢！\n微信公众号与博客的区别\n\n本来，老T以为微信公众号只是另一个信息发布平台，在已有文稿的基础上，简单发布即可。但由于微信天然的社交属性，这种想法很快就破灭了。微信公众号和博客看似都是写作平台，但本质上差异巨大，尤其是传播机制、读者互动和写作要求等方面。下面，老T就结合这 10 天的亲身经历，谈谈几点主要区别。\n推荐算法与搜索排名\n\n微信公众号的核心是推荐算法，它像一个无形的编辑，总在决定每篇文章能不能被推送到更多人面前。老T感觉这些天来，无时无刻不在被算法左右：文章标题要吸引人、内容要迎合读者口味、甚至发布时间都要卡点。\n举个例子，老T的公众号目前总阅读量约 2.2 万，其中 90.4% 都来自算法推荐。如果算法不喜欢老T的文章，它就静静躺在后台，阅读量寥寥无几。\n相比之下，博客更像一个安静的图书馆，主要面对搜索引擎。文章一发，就扔到网络大海里，由用户自己去搜索、发现。没有算法的“喜好”来左右，不管写的是专业知识还是个人心得，都只是共享出去，设置好关键词，等着有缘人来找。例如，老T的博客文章，很多都是 10 几年前写的，但通过搜索引擎，至今还能带来流量。\n这种区别让写作心态完全不同。在微信上，老T得使劲琢磨“算法会不会推”，而在博客，老T只需问自己“这个内容有没有价值”就行。\n订阅数\n\n微信公众号的价值很大程度上取决于粉丝数。粉丝越多，推送就越稳，阅读基数越高。老T这 10 天，粉丝从 0 涨到 100+，主要靠算法推荐拉新。但目前粉丝基数很小，新文章容易石沉大海。\n博客的订阅数（比如 RSS 或邮件订阅）则没那么关键。博客读者往往是零散的搜索流量，订阅只是锦上添花。老T的博客订阅者不多，但文章通过 SEO 优化，也能持续吸引新访客。简单说，微信更像是是“粉丝经济”，而博客一直是“内容长尾”，前者靠积累人气，后者靠积累内容。\n另外，这里老T再补充另一个经常使用的知乎平台情况，完全是另外一套逻辑的。知乎既不靠粉丝数，也不靠搜索引擎，甚至也可以说不靠算法推荐。因为它默认使用算法将问题推送给所有潜在创作者和读者，创作者只需要沿着知乎推荐的问题进行回答即可获得大量自然流量，也算是另一种“算法平权”。例如，老T最近一个月在知乎的回答几个问题，累计阅读近 40 万，绝大多数阅读量都来源于用户被知乎问题所吸引而点进页面后查看的。不管是作为创作者还是用户，老T都完全不用担心算法或关注数的影响。\n\n\n写作风格\n\n这 10 天下来，老T感觉微信公众号的生态不适合太长、太专业的写法。读者大多用的是碎片化时间在阅读，刷朋友圈或订阅号时，更喜欢短平快的内容。老T花大力气写了几篇 5000 字以上的长文，比如分析印度强奸率、研究外国人如何看待93阅兵等，但阅读量和推荐最多的，反而是飞牛 NAS 相关的那些 2000 字以内的实用性文章。当然，这也可能因为内容差异，几篇长的文章，公众号后台审核后都明确不给推荐。\n博客则更注重专业性和深度。没有什么限制，可以尽情展开，写成万字长文也没关系，因为读者是主动搜索来的，往往有特定需求。老T在博客上写的那些长篇内容，阅读量虽不高，但反馈很专业，读者留言讨论也更深入。微信像快餐，博客像大餐，前者求速，后者求精。\n推荐限制的不确定性\n\n微信的运营规范有 23000 多字四五百条内容，说是包罗万象也不夸张。但创作者并不知道这些具体规范的阈值，只有写完提交后，才能从助推审核结果中看出端倪。老T阅读量最少的那几篇文章，至今没搞清到底因为什么原因不给推荐，反正后台通知就一句话：“不符合微信公众平台运营规范”。\n博客则没这些烦恼，只要遵纪守法即可，搜索引擎抓取后，更多的由用户自己判断。顶多是 SEO 优化的问题，但至少透明可控。\n结语\n\n总之，这10天让老T深刻感受到，微信公众号更像一场算法游戏，需要不断试错、优化。而博客则更适合个性化创作，注重长效价值。当然，两者不是非此即彼，老T会继续双管齐下，保持两边同步更新。希望这些心得对其他创作者有帮助。如果你也有类似经历，欢迎留言交流！",

          "description": "2020年，老T曾以这个标题写过一篇简单的 文章，主要是因为当年在百度上搜索这个问题答案时，找到的都是千篇一律洗稿内容，鲜有能够讲清这个问题的文章。\n甚至可以说，当时网上大多数关于这个问题的解答都是在瞎扯。有些讨论下边，还各种对提问者挖苦、讥讽，认为提问者丝毫不懂网络常识，但又不给出解决问题的思路办法。由于当年老T也恰好遇到这个问题，便进行一番研究。\n现今5年过去，国内网络环境又与此前有了一些不同，千兆宽带已成标配，甚至万兆宽带也开始进入部分家庭，老T觉得有必要重新对这个问题进行梳理。\n为何1000M光纤宽带，测速只有300M？\n\n当年老T遇到这个问题，首要原因就出在路由器上。\n在1000M光纤刚开始进入千家万户的时候，由于多数家庭用户还在使用旧型号路由器，有些路由器虽然参数上写着支持 1000Mbps 网口，但那个网速只是供内网传输使用的，内外网之间的速度并不能达到 1000M。\n也就是说，在内网配置没有明显问题的情况下，用户将两台电脑同时用网线连接到路由器时，这两台电脑之间的内网传输速度能够达到 1000Mbps。\n而当用户通过这台路由器连接外网时，这时由于路由器内部芯片处理能力限制，传输速度就会骤减至 300-500Mbps。\n老T 画了个示意图，争取把这个逻辑展示清楚。\n\n\n5年前，不少家庭用户都是因为这个情况导致测速结果达不到运营商标称的速度。\n例如：\n网件 R7000 WAN TO LAN 最大速率：931 Mbps \n网件 R6300v2 WAN TO LAN 最大速率：806 Mbps \n华硕 AC68U WAN TO LAN 最大速率: 754.5 Mbps \nTP-LINK TGR1900 WAN TO LAN 最大速率: 631 Mbps\n网件 R6100 WAN TO LAN 最大速率: 93.1 Mbps\n不过，当年老T 遇到的问题比这个还稍微复杂…",

          "description": "20年前由胡歌、刘亦菲、安以轩、刘品言、彭于晏等联袂主演的《仙剑奇侠传》中，李逍遥那一句“我要送你平平安安地回到南诏国，那才是你真正的故乡”第一次了解到了南诏国。后来金庸笔下的《天龙八部》和《射雕英雄传》更是让这里披上了侠骨柔情的神秘面纱。\n那么说走就走，出发云南…\n\n飞机落地丽江三义机场，故事也由丽江这座古城开始…\n﻿29年前的一场7.0级大地震，真正打开了丽江的知名度，此时的全国人民才通过CCTV了解到了丽江，这里是纳西族人的聚集地，有大研古镇、束河古镇、白沙古镇，而大家常说的丽江古城通常指的是大研古镇。\n如今这座古镇里却很少有本地居民，30年本地导游经验的纳西族女导游的家就曾在古城里，全家早已搬出去自建新房，古城里的院子出租价格特别的高。\n\n丽江古城和远处的玉龙雪山\n玉龙雪山是纳西人心中的神山，像一位披着白袍的守护者，伫立在丽江古城的背后，抬头便能见，低头却难忘。\n\n这座城随处都是咖啡店和酒吧，云南本地小粒咖啡没啥兴趣，酒吧听歌有点贵，40瓶风花雪月300ml啤酒加点小食敢收费2200元…  驻唱的小妹还是很会活跃气氛的。\n\n虽然到不了蒙自市，但过桥米线在古城里却随处都是。过桥米线分由米线、高汤 、拼盘三个主要部分组成，米线是它的基础、高汤是它的灵魂，而拼盘辅料则是这碗米线的生命。过桥米线的拼盘辅料主要由各种肉类和蔬菜组成，是构成过桥米线的基本元素。\n玉龙雪山\n次日前往世界上北半球纬度最低、海拔最高的玉龙雪山，远远的就能看到海拔5590.2米的扇子陡主峰。进山费100元/人，冰川大索道140元/人，大巴车60元/人，蓝月谷虽然免费但也得单独购买电瓶车票。时间关系牦牛坪索道65元/人，云杉坪索道60元/人就没去了。\n\n玉龙雪山冰川公园大索道比去年华山北峰索道要险得多，华山都是大石头，而玉龙雪山的岩石主要以石灰岩为主，这类岩石质地脆弱，容易破碎，难以承受较大重量，所以玉龙雪山至今从未被人类登顶过。\n\n玉龙雪山冰川大索道起点海拔3356米，冰川大索道终点海拔4506米，然后开始沿着人造木梯爬到海拔4680米的观景台。没有氧气和士力架会有点废命，当然在上山前，还喝了瓶西洋参灵芝饮，用于提升血红蛋白携氧能力，缓解缺氧导致的疲劳。感觉这玩意有点坑，当然安全下山，不太累才是最重要的。\n\n\n山水的感受就一个字，冷~ 单薄的九分裤+短袖T恤和防晒服，在海拔4680处，温度只有5°，虽然有太阳，但抵不住风大。\n\n下山一碗野生菌火锅，暖和暖和。\n\n\n\n山脚下纳西人家房子的屋顶，纳西人的下午茶，玉龙雪山前视乎很早以前就有飞机起降\n\n晚上的丽江城区，车水马龙，每天都会堵车\n束河古镇\n\n这里房价现在还比较便宜，都是出租或出售给外来人口做生意用的，均价10000/㎡ …\n\n但具体的还要看具体位置，必经古镇内，每个位置的价格差距都很大，哪些好的位置也是有价无市，因为没人会卖。\n\n愿余生花开四季，向阳而生，不畏将来，不念过往\n\n关于云南咖啡的历史\n\n纳西族，使用东巴文，也是一种象形文字\n\n纳西族-东巴木雕\n\n从丽江去到大理，走大丽高速195公里，途经剑湖。\n\n这里是金庸笔下《天龙八部》剑湖的原型。\n喜洲\n\n洱海北端，喜洲，风吹麦浪，乘坐了喜洲小火车…\n大理古城\n\n在大理，苍山和洱海是固定搭配， 永远分不开的一对。\n\n大理古城，背靠苍山，面朝洱海。\n\n蚕蛹和蜂蛹，据说都是蛋白质\n\n金蝎和竹虫，唉~ 还是不敢尝试\n\n蚂蚱和蜈蚣，蚂蚱试了下，挺香的。\n\n云南虫谷…了解下价格把~\n8-12世纪东南亚第一大古都 大理\n\n大理是唐、五代、两宋时期南诏、大长和、大天兴、大义宁、大理国、大中六第方政权王朝的都城，以500多年的建都史与西安、北京、洛阳、南京、开封等成为中华历史上享有盛名的古都都市，是同时连接茶马古道及西南，西北，海上三条丝绸之路的文化，宗教，经济贸易交流中心。\n\n明代洪武十五年（公元1382年），将原城改建为方形城，城四面建城门楼，四角建角楼，城内建“五华楼”。现大理古城基本保留了明代格局，残存部分城墙，南北城门均为公元1984年重建。\n\n大理古城，一水绕苍山，苍山抱古城。\n大理、吴哥、顺化、曼谷等城市是东南亚地区不同历史时期的大古都，尤其是大理 8-12世纪的南诏，大理国等中国地方政权王朝的都城，其规模宏大、文化发达、经济繁荣，是当时亚洲经济、文化、宗教交流的中心之一。\n\n这里接头的水果小吃五颜六色\n\n七彩云南\n\n马帮菜是茶马古道上形成的特色饮食体系，源于古代马帮风餐露宿的生存需求。\n\n其核心特征为\"食材信手拈来，可食用之材皆可成菜\"，善用山茅野菜、干巴、野生菌等自然食材，形成以\"干、鲜、野\"为主的烹饪体系。\n理想邦-圣托里尼风情的摄影天堂\n\n可惜，这天下午开始下雨了，那就提早返程把。\n\n卷烟，云南特产，带两条回家。",

          "description": "国庆前最后的一个工作日加班到深夜回家，也不想10月01日当天在外凑热闹，拖拖拉拉到10月02日的中午才出发，虽然沃尔沃S60国庆出发前做了很多的准备，但只到上车那一刻，才决定最终往那走…\n\n麒麟大口茶，是街道口银泰内刚开的一家，云南风味的茶，全店就一个单品，第一口上去未到怪怪的，下次去云南再喝喝其它品种看看。\n楼下酸奶，武商梦时代内新开，做得很好看，有香港丝袜奶茶的口感和味道。\n\n不知道吃啥，最终还是在来菜吃的，就别管它是不是预制菜了，怎么吃都会有后悔。\n10月01号当天，吃吃逛逛，买了点零食，就准备次日出发。\n10月02日起床已经是上午10点，12点30分折腾出门，一路西北方向，出武汉市区，就开始下雨，而这场雨也基本上覆盖了整个奇葩的旅途。因为有雨，所以天黑得特别的早，16点左右自动大灯就已自动开启了照明模式，而此时也刚刚通过十堰市附近的武当山收费站，后面的200公里山路，也就是中国的南北分界线秦岭。\n\nMANER长途必备，服务区有KFC，能解决吃饭问题。\n\nG70福银高速，安陆服务区，有一辆功臣号坦克，但下着雨，人也多，就没怎么看。过了十堰武当山之后，天就基本黑了。\n早在2024年 武汉-敦煌，自驾青甘大环线之旅 时，就走过这条线路，但这次是夜晚，而且下着雨，还有各种大货车。\nG70福银高速穿越秦岭的一段，是穿越秦岭最优质的路线之一，一路风景很美，只可惜这次是夜晚还下着雨，最终在距离西安80公里的蓝田服务区咪了会。\n24小时后本着不走回头路的想法，选择G40沪陕高速再次在雨中穿越秦岭从西安返回武汉，安全起见基本上除部分隧道限速80外，基本是压着120的时速跑，偶尔超车到140的速度，雨天很爽，只是这油耗和轮胎损耗，确实比常规高速要略高一点。\n雨天高速油耗会更高\n这一路往返共1557公里，加了680元油，平均每公里 0.44元，看来高速雨天的行驶成本会略高\n雨天轮胎磨损会更大\n当然除了油耗外，雨天行驶汽车轮胎的磨损也会更大 Michelin PRIMACY 4 是 S60的原厂配置轮胎，本身就很软，轮胎含有天然橡胶在雨天会吸收水分后会更加的软，所以导致硬度下降除了更容易被尖锐物品刺破外，雨天的路面摩擦力更小，而车辆行驶和刹车所需要的摩擦力度则会加大，反而造成轮胎更快的磨损。\n\n出秦岭一段38.8公里的下山路，百公里油耗 3.3升，是这台沃尔沃最低的一次，比起德令哈到西宁都低。\n当然平时驾车习惯就不会让轮胎磨损太快，本着能不踩刹车时，绝不多踩一脚。所以即使是轮胎5年的日历寿命差不多时，一般轮胎的排水防滑沟槽还挺深，毕竟每年长途需求还挺多，轮胎上绝不能含糊。\n长安24时辰\n在蓝田服务区眯了会，就被秦岭深处的寒气冻醒，此时凌晨5点，车外温度10度，而自己只有短裤短袖… 洗把脸继续将车开到了西安。好在10月03日的上午没下雨，能让我逛个南门早市、城墙、钟鼓楼和回民街，下午回酒店咪了会，晚上逛了下大唐不夜城，次日一早，就急匆匆的往武汉赶。\n不得不临时终止本次行程，还没到下一站甘南天水，就提前返回武汉，然后~ 自己的2025年国庆中秋假期也就这么过去了。\n这是连续第4年，第N次来西安，看来是真的喜欢这里\n\n西安城墙下奈雪的茶，本地奶茶-茶话弄，还有石榴汁确实好喝\n\n南门早市人真的多，张记的凉粉和肉夹馍\n\n糊辣羊蹄，肚包肉，烤串\n\n这次试试老孙家羊肉泡馍，赶时间，没要手掰\n\n在西安待过半个月以上，才吃的懂这碗水盆羊肉\n哎~ 24时辰过得太快\n回一下之前的西安\n十三朝古都-长安-碳水之都\n十天之后再到长安\n从长安到奉天，从咸阳到沈阳\n华山西峰索道关闭，双腿已废\n附上一张近期的蛋疼的西安天气\n\n附穿越秦岭的6条高速\nG40沪陕高速，从西安古城出发前往河南省南阳市段\nG70福银高速，蓝田县三里镇的席家河村到商州区的西涧乡\nG65包茂高速，从长安区的太乙宫开始穿越秦岭至柞水县的营盘\nG5京昆高速，北起西安的鄠邑区涝峪口南至汉中的勉县元墩\nG85银昆高速，秦岭北侧的宝鸡市到秦岭南侧的汉中市\n附穿越秦岭的5条国道\n108国道，即古傥骆道‌，洋县傥水河口到周至西骆峪，也是安史之乱唐玄宗逃离长安的路线\n210国道，即古子午道，西安至西乡，开辟于秦代，北出口为长安县子午谷\n211国道，连接西安和安康，即古峪谷道，隋唐时期开辟\n244国道，古褒斜道，从汉中到眉县，开辟于东汉，蜀道难即为此道\n242国道，连接华阴和洛南，穿越华山",

          "description": "条件分支预测器逆向工程（以 Apple M1 Firestorm 为例）¶\n背景¶\n去年我完成了针对 Apple 和 Qualcomm 条件分支预测器（Conditional Branch Predictor）的逆向工程研究，相关论文已发表在 arXiv 上，并公开了源代码。考虑到许多读者对处理器逆向工程感兴趣，但可能因其复杂性而望而却步，本文将以 Apple M1 Firestorm 为例，详细介绍条件分支预测器的逆向工程方法，作为对原论文的补充说明。\n\n背景知识¶\n首先介绍一些背景知识。要逆向工程条件分支预测器，需要先了解其工作原理。条件分支预测器的基本思路是：\n\n条件分支的跳转行为（跳转或不跳转）通常是高度可预测的\n预测器的输入包括条件分支的地址，以及近期执行的若干条分支的历史记录；输出则是预测该条件分支是否跳转\n\n为了在硬件上实现这一算法，处理器会维护一个预测表，表中每一项包含一个 2 位饱和计数器，用于预测跳转方向。查表时，系统会对条件分支地址以及近期执行的分支历史进行哈希运算，使用哈希结果作为索引读取表项，然后根据计数器的值来预测分支的跳转方向。\n\n（图源：CMU ECE740 Computer Architecture: Branch Prediction）\n目前主流处理器普遍采用 TAGE 预测器，它在上述基础查表方法的基础上进行了重要改进：\n\n观察到不同分支的预测所需的历史长度各不相同：有些分支无需历史信息即可准确预测，有些依赖近期分支的跳转结果，而有些则需要更久远的历史信息；\n分支历史越长，可能的路径组合就越多，导致预测器训练过程变慢，训练期间的预测错误率较高，因此希望尽快收敛；\n为满足不同分支对历史长度的需求，TAGE 设计了多个预测表，每个表使用不同长度的分支历史。多个表同时进行预测，当多个表都提供预测结果时（仅在 tag 匹配时提供预测），选择使用…",

          "description": "本博客近三个月来的访问数据观察¶\n写在前面¶\n这个博客自 2014 年更新至今，已走过近十一个年头，累计发布了四百多篇文章。出于好奇，我一直想了解哪些内容更受读者欢迎。五年前，我曾配置过 Google Analytics，但使用体验并不理想，于是转而自行部署了 rybbit 实例来收集访问数据。如今三个月过去，是时候与大家分享一些有趣的发现。\nP.S. 如果你对数据收集有所顾虑，可以屏蔽对应的 analytics 脚本。\n\n数据总览与趋势¶\n首先来看这三个月内的整体访问情况与趋势：\n\n访问量比我的预期要高一些。虽然这些年写了不少内容，但并没有刻意宣传，主要依赖搜索引擎推荐和读者的订阅与转发。从时间趋势上可以看出两个明显特点：\n\n工作日访问量显著高于周末，通常为周末的两到三倍；\n开学后工作日的访问量比暑假期间又高出一倍，但周末依然低迷。\n\n由此推测，学生读者占比较高。结合国庆假期访问量的下降来看，国内读者仍是主力。下面是各国家与地区的访问分布：\n\n值得一提的是，也有不少海外读者访问，看来近年来有意识地撰写英文内容确实产生了效果。\n以 UTC+8 时区为基准，从访问时间分布中可以看出大家的作息习惯：\n\n尽管大家可能习惯熬夜，但深夜阅读博客的并不多，多数访问集中在工作时间。\n接下来是基于 User Agent 的统计。首先是浏览器分布：\n\n不出所料，Chrome 及基于 Chromium 内核的浏览器占据主流，Firefox 和 Safari 占比不高。我本人目前也在使用 Firefox，希望它能持续发展，避免 Chrome 一家独大。\n操作系统分布如下：\n\nWindows 占比最高，macOS 次之。考虑到博客内容主要涉及计算机技术，这也大致反映了相关从业人员的偏好。\n以下是访问次数较多的几篇文章：\n\nACPI 学习笔记: 886 次\nNVIDIA 驱动和 CUDA 版本信息速查: 835 次\n在 QEMU 中运行 OpenBMC: 725 次\nSPEC CPU 2006 性能测试: 520 次\nMIFARE Classic 上配置 NDEF: 464 次\n\n这个排名有些出乎我的意料。这几篇文章在撰写时并未特别考虑入门读者的理解难度或内容的丰富性。或许是因为它们涉及的领域资料较少，因此在相关关键词搜索中容易被找到。这一点在 Google Search Console 中也得到了印证：\n\n相比之下，一些精心准备的文章阅读量并不高，可能是因为所在领域已有较多优质内容，新文章难以脱颖而出。这也说明文章质量与阅读量之间并非简单的正比关系。\n我还注意到一些重度用户，他们不仅阅读多篇文章，且停留时间较长：\n\n未知用户一：阅读了分支预测、乱序执行、CPU 微架构分析等文章，推测可能是刚开始研究 CPU 微架构的同行；\n未知用户二：浏览了 wishbone、乱序执行相关内容，猜测是学习清华计算机组成原理课程的学生；\n未知用户三：从华为相关文章进入，随后浏览了其他内容，可能是搜索华为内容进入博客后，被其他文章吸引的读者；\n未知用户四：阅读了 ARM/Samsung/Intel 等处理器微架构分析文章，又一位同行，但有一定基础，更加关注业界。\n\n类似的例子还有不少，在此不一一列举。尽管 CPU 相关文章的阅读量不及软件类内容，但能得到这么多同行的关注，确实令人欣慰——毕竟这本身就是一个小众领域，不能奢求过高的阅读量。\n通过这次数据分析，我收获了不少有趣的观察。未来可能会不定期更新类似内容，看看随着时间推移，是否会有新的发现。\n最后，如果你对访问数据的收集感到不适，可以直接屏蔽 analytics 脚本（或许你的浏览器插件已经这样做了）。根据 rybbit 的官方说明，其信息收集方法较为尊重用户隐私，我也没有对代码进行任何修改，不放心的读者可以阅读 rybbit 的源码来审计。\nP.S. 你能看出这篇文章是，我先写了一遍，然后让大模型润色的结果吗？",
